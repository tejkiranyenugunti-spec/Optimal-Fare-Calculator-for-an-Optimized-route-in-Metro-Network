# **Optimal Fare Calculator for an Optimized route in Metro Network**
The aim of this project is to implement a fare calculator for a metro network in such a way that it utilizes the concepts and algorithms using graph data structures and shortest path algorithms to optimize the implementation of fare calculator in a way that it provides the best optimized fare for the public people to use. This report contains the detailed discussion of the data structures used in the project Graphs and one of the most common implementations of graphs using adjacency matrix. Weighted graphs are used for the best representation of a real world scenario, which is taking into account the distances between metro stations of the network and also gives options of entering age and disabilities to provide the users with discounts. The report also contains a concise algorithm for the fare calculator using the shortest path algorithm which contains detailed conditional checks to ensure all the features are implemented. There is a flow chart for the ease of understanding of the algorithm. Finally, the complete implementation of the algorithm in C programming language, which is well structured, readable and modular, that is the repeated code is put into functions that can be called when needed.
